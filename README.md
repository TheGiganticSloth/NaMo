# NaMo
 ------ Nano Move ------

A Python script I used to move nanowires with the use of AFM (Bruker Dimension Icon). Currently used in a notebook.

There are examples of rotations, translations and complete move. Feel free to suggest improvement.

nanowires on a flat surface”. In : Nanotechnology 28.36 (2017), p. 365301.
